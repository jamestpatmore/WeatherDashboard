## Description

:open_umbrella::open_umbrella::open_umbrella:
Under1Umbrella (Dynamic 5-Day forecast application)
:open_umbrella::open_umbrella::open_umbrella:

This is a frontend javascript application using Server Side APIs. In this instance I am using OpenWeathers API for finding accuarate weather data for the location recieved :rainbow:

## Usage 

It is a pretty straightforward application that takes user input within the search bar on the navigation toolbar and loads a current and 5-day forecast for the city that is searched. 

You can view the deployment link [here]():milky_way:

## User Story 

```md
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria 

```md
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## Credits

I did use [MdBootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com) a Bootstrap affiliate to create a template for this application which helped me focus on the data population of the application.
